# Genogram Resources

A curated collection of resources for creating genograms - family diagrams used in therapy, social work, medicine, and counseling.

## What is a Genogram?

A genogram is a graphical representation of a family tree that displays detailed information about relationships, medical history, and behavioral patterns across multiple generations. Unlike simple family trees, genograms use standardized symbols to show emotional relationships, medical conditions, and other clinically relevant information.
